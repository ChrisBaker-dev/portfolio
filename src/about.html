        <h4>Where I am now.</h4>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Christopher Baker, a web developer student at Coder Academy's intensive program
          in Brisbane Queensland. I joined this program in order to further develop my software technical
          abilities, skills and I enjoy the challenge of an intensive program. Prior to Coder Academy, I was studying 
          Computer Science at the University of Queensland in Saint Lucia. Outside of software, I enjoy playing lacrosse,
          video games and helping out my community. Currently, I sit as the President of the Queensland Lacrosse Association,
          we oversee all of the Lacrosse development happening within Queensland, and I am a volunteer rural firefighter with the 
          Bellthorpe Rural Fire Brigade.

        <p>
          In 2013, I graduated from the Santa Rosa Junior College Fire Academy in Santa Rosa California. This was an immense
          accomplishment in my life because this academy required me to be training from 8am to 5pm everyday, pass daily exams, fitness 
          tests and follow strict protocols. I was also concurrently enrolled into an arithmia course because I wanted to become a 
          firefighter-paramedic. What made this such an achievement in my life was the ability to challenge myself on a daily basis in 
          order to pass these hurdles while maintaining my job. I graduated the academy with distinction as a Squad Leader.

          I have many more stories to tell about my career, but they will be completed in the near future. This is merely a display of
          how this page will be layed out and how the photos will alternate between sides/screen sizes.
