# Website URL

# Purpose:
To build a solid foundational website that reflects my personal skills, interests and abilities. My goal is to make a webpage that is:
1. Responsive
2. Engaging
3. Acessible
4. Technical
5. Intuitive
6. Has quick navigation options

# Features/Functionality
**Hamburger navigation menu** - Whenever the page is resized below 600 pixels, the navigation bar at the top will be collapsed into a menu with an icon which will allow access. This type of icon is used across various applications around the world and should be immediately recognizable. This is the only feature which was created with the help of w3schools. 

W3schools.com. 2021. How To Create a Responsive Top Navigation Menu. [online] Available at: <https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp> [Accessed 11 March 2021].

**Responsive resizing** - Certain pages will change their layout depending on the size of device viewing. 

index.html - The most noticeable change would be on the index.html file (homepage). This file will change from a single column grid, small device/ phone view, to a grid with 2 columns and 3 rows (desktop view). Certain elements on this page will change as well such as the loss of a navbar on the desktop view and the addition of buttons on the left side of the page. This index.html desktop view is intended to mimic a business card.

about.html -  this page is styled to represent a timeline of important moments or milestones in my life that have helped shaped who I am today. In order to do this, I start with a current photo and description of where I am now, followed by a photo designed to mimic a polaroid photo with a date and description. In the desktop view, polaroids will sit to either the left or right of their accompanying text, whereas on mobile, the photo will always be about the text.

**Accessibility** - Each page is semantically correct without errors or warnings.

**Containers** - Throughout the site there are containers with a similar shading around them. These containers are intended to allow me to add projects, blog articles or other information about me without hurting the aesthetic of my portfolio. These containers have slight shading around the outside border to catch a users eye, titles, decriptions and other useful information depending on the page. Example shown below:

Blog container:

About Me container (Polaroid):

**Text Stylizing** - Depending on the content being viewed, text will be stylized to embolden content. For example, Project names or blog titles will have a large emboldened font, blog publishing dates/publisher names will have smalled emboldened fonts and text will be standard. The About Me polaroid photos will have cursive text for a more realistic feel.

**Icons** - On each page, a user will be able to quickly reference social media platforms (github, twitter, linkedin) and my resume. The icons are located in a fixed position on the left of each page, except the index (desktop size screen), where they are located at the bottom left.

**Profile Images** - Located on the index.html and about.html pages, there is a circular photo (similar to facebook). This is intended to stand out from other content as an updated graphic.

**Active pages and hover** - The search bar at the top of each page has active and hover elements attributed to them to help a user easily navigate the portfolio. Active items are located to the left, in blue on each page and hover elements are green.
